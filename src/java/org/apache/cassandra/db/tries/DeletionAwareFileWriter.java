/// Serializes a [DeletionAwareTrie] using the [FileWriter] on-disk trie format.
///
/// ## Where the deletion branch pointer lives
///
/// [OnDiskWriteNodeType] has no room for a deletion branch: the node code is
/// `nodeCode >> 3`, all 32 type codes are assigned (LEAF 0-7, CHAIN 8-15, SPARSE 16-27,
/// BITMAP 28, DENSE 29, PREFIX 30, RELAY 31), and PREFIX's three flag bits are all in
/// use (`HAS_CHILD`, `HAS_ASCENT_CONTENT`, `HAS_DESCENT_CONTENT`).
///
/// A node does, however, have a spare payload slot. A generic-content node carries content on both the
/// descent and the ascent (return) path, and the data trie of a deletion-aware trie only ever presents
/// content on descent (see the `presentContentOnDescentPath` argument
/// [InMemoryDeletionAwareTrie] passes to its base) — so nothing ever fills its ascent-side slot. The
/// deletion branch's root position goes there, as a minimal-width reversed integer whose length the
/// node's own length prefix carries. This is the same reuse the in-memory trie makes of a prefix node's
/// secondary pointer, which holds return-path content in a range trie and the alternate branch in a
/// deletion-aware one (see `PREFIX_ALTERNATE_OFFSET` and the prefix node section of `InMemoryTrie.md`).
///
/// A payload with no deletion branch is therefore byte-for-byte what a plain trie would write for the
/// same content, and the node code's descent- and ascent-content bits are exactly
/// [Cursor#MAY_HAVE_CONTENT_BIT] and [Cursor#MAY_HAVE_DELETION_BRANCH_BIT], so the reader produces both
/// flags without decoding anything.
///
/// ## Ordering
///
/// [FileWriter] writes nodes bottom-up as the walk ascends, so every pointer it emits
/// points backwards. [DeletionAwareCursor#process] visits a node's content, then its
/// deletion branch, then descends into its children, and the node itself is written
/// after its children. Serializing the deletion branch when the walk leaves it therefore
/// places those bytes before both the children and the node that references them, and
/// the recorded root is a valid backward pointer.
///
/// A branch trie is complete in itself, so its root is the position reached once it has
/// been fully written — the same convention [OnDiskTrie#open] uses when it takes the
/// file length as the root.
/// Note this *holds* a [FileWriter] rather than extending it: the underlying writer is a
/// `Walker<Slot<T>>` while this is a `Walker<T>`, and Java does not permit inheriting the
/// same interface with two different type arguments.
