/// The two root-deletion accessors, [DeletionAwareTrie#deletionBranchAtRoot] and [DeletionAwareTrie#deletionAtRoot],
/// have two implementations and nothing compared them until this class existed.
///
/// [InMemoryDeletionAwareTrie] overrides both with a structural shortcut that reads the root's alternate branch
/// directly and never positions a cursor. [OnDiskDeletionAwareTrie] does not override, so the reader -- and every
/// other view built by the algebra -- runs the cursor-based defaults in [DeletionAwareTrie]. The two answers are
/// consumed interchangeably: `TriePartitionUpdate` and `TrieBackedPartitionStage3` iterate `deletionBranchAtRoot()`
/// to emit partition deletions, and `TrieBackedRow` uses both to decide whether a row is empty. A disagreement is
/// therefore a silent wrong answer -- a partition deletion that vanishes on write, or a row wrongly reported empty --
/// rather than a failure, which is why the central assertion here is the differential between the override and the
/// default rather than a comparison with an expected list.
///
/// The second trap the accessors carry is the distinction from [DeletionAwareTrie#deletionOnlyTrie]:
/// `deletionBranchAtRoot` reports only the branch rooted at the root and must be empty when the deletions sit lower,
/// while `deletionOnlyTrie` reports all of them wherever they are. Reading one for the other is over- or
/// under-deletion at the partition level, so both directions of that distinction are asserted.
///
/// `bits` is parameterised because it selects the node type the on-disk reader has to decode; `deletionsAtRoot`
/// because it is what decides whether the deletion branch of the built trie sits at the root or below it.
