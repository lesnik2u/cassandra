/// Merges with a deletion-aware trie read back off disk as an operand.
///
/// This is the gap the on-disk suites leave: they write a trie, read it back, walk it and compare it with the
/// in-memory one it came from, and stop there. A walk asks a cursor for its content and its children. A merge asks it
/// where it is once it has ended, and asks its deletion branch for the range active at a position -- [MergeCursor],
/// [CollectionMergeCursor], [RangeIntersectionCursor] and [DeletionAwareMergeSource] all call `precedingState` on
/// their sources. Both of the reader defects that reached review, and the one this class was written alongside, sit
/// in that second set of calls, and all three produce a wrong answer rather than a failure: rows that are in neither
/// operand, or a tombstone applied to a branch it does not cover.
///
/// The sides are parameterised because they are not symmetric in the cursor code -- a merge advances whichever source
/// is behind, so which one is read back off disk decides which paths are taken -- and `bits` because it is what
/// selects the node type the reader has to decode, which is how the bitmap and dense readers came to ship untested.
