/// In-memory trie built for fast modification and reads executing concurrently with writes from a single mutator thread.
///
/// The main method for performing writes is [#apply(Trie,UpsertTransformer,Predicate)] which takes a trie as
/// an argument and merges it into the current trie using the methods supplied by the given [UpsertTransformer],
/// force copying anything below the points where the third argument returns true.
///
///
/// The predicate can be used to implement several forms of atomicity and consistency guarantees:
///   -  if the predicate is `nf -> false`, neither atomicity nor sequential consistency is guaranteed - readers
///     can see any mixture of old and modified content
///   -  if the predicate is `nf -> true`, full sequential consistency will be provided, i.e. if a reader sees any
///     part of a modification, it will see all of it, and all the results of all previous modifications
///   -  if the predicate is `nf -> nf.isBranching()` the write will be atomic, i.e. either none or all of the
///     content of the merged trie will be visible by concurrent readers, but not sequentially consistent, i.e. there
///     may be writes that are not visible to a reader even when they precede writes that are visible.
///   -  if the predicate is `nf -> <some_test>(nf.content())` the write will be consistent below the identified
///     point (used e.g. by Memtable to ensure partition-level consistency)
///
///
///     Additionally, the class provides several simpler write methods for efficiency and convenience:
///   -  [#putRecursive(ByteComparable,Object,UpsertTransformer)] inserts a single value using a recursive walk.
///     It cannot provide consistency (single-path writes are always atomic). This is more efficient as it stores the
///     walk state in the stack rather than on the heap but can cause a `StackOverflowException`.
///   -  [#putSingleton(ByteComparable,Object,UpsertTransformer)] is a non-recursive version of the above, using
///     the `apply` machinery.
///   -  [#putSingleton(ByteComparable,Object,UpsertTransformer,boolean)] uses the fourth argument to choose
///     between the two methods above, where some external property can be used to decide if the keys are short enough
///     to permit recursive execution.
///
///     Because it uses 32-bit pointers in byte buffers, this trie has a fixed size limit of 2GB.
