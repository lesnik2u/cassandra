///
/// The on-disk suites only ever walk a trie and compare it with the in-memory one it was written from. A walk asks a
/// cursor for its content and for its children; it never asks a [RangeCursor] for [RangeCursor#state] or
/// [RangeCursor#precedingState], and it never takes a tail. Both of the worst defects found on the on-disk reader --
/// a range tail presenting unrestricted content at its root, and a range branch tail leaving the active range set
/// from the node's unrestricted content -- lived in exactly that combination, and both would have been reported as a
/// deletion covering a whole branch that it does not apply to. Every merge and intersection asks its sources for the
/// deletion active at their root, so a wrong answer there is a silent over- or under-deletion rather than a crash.

/// The tests below therefore compare states as well as walks, and take tails at every prefix rather than only at the
