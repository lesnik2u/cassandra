/// A merged view of multiple trie cursors.
///
/// This is accomplished by walking the cursors in parallel; the merged cursor takes the position and features of the
/// smallest and advances with it; when multiple cursors are equal, all of them are advanced. The ordered view of the
/// cursors is maintained using a custom binary min-heap, built for efficiently reforming the heap when the top elements
/// are advanced.
///
/// Crucial for the efficiency of this is the fact that when they are advanced like this, we can compare cursors'
/// positions by their `depth` descending and then `incomingTransition` ascending.
/// See [Trie.md](./Trie.md) for further details.
///
/// The merge cursor is a variation of the idea of a merge iterator with one key observation: because we advance
/// the source iterators together, we can compare them just by depth and incoming transition.
///
/// The most straightforward way to implement merging of iterators is to use a `PriorityQueue`,
/// `poll` it to find the next item to consume, then `add` the iterator back after advancing.
/// This is not very efficient as `poll` and `add` in all cases require at least
/// `log(size)` comparisons and swaps (usually more than `2*log(size)`) per consumed item, even
/// if the input is suitable for fast iteration.
///
/// The implementation below makes use of the fact that replacing the top element in a binary heap can be
/// done much more efficiently than separately removing it and placing it back, especially in the cases where
/// the top iterator is to be used again very soon (e.g. when there are large sections of the output where
/// only a limited number of input iterators overlap, which is normally the case in many practically useful
/// situations, e.g. levelled compaction).
///
/// The implementation builds and maintains a binary heap of sources (stored in an array), where we do not
/// add items after the initial construction. Instead we advance the smallest element (which is at the top
/// of the heap) and push it down to find its place for its new position. Should this source be exhausted,
/// we swap it with the last source in the heap and proceed by pushing that down in the heap.
///
/// In the case where we have multiple sources with matching positions, the merging algorithm
/// must be able to merge all equal values. To achieve this `content` walks the heap to
/// find all equal cursors without advancing them, and separately `advance` advances
/// all equal sources and restores the heap structure.
///
/// The latter is done equivalently to the process of initial construction of a min-heap using back-to-front
/// heapification as done in the classic heapsort algorithm. It only needs to heapify subheaps whose top item
/// is advanced (i.e. one whose position matches the current), and we can do that recursively from
/// bottom to top. Should a source be exhausted when advancing, it can be thrown away by swapping in the last
/// source in the heap (note: we must be careful to advance that source too if required).
///
/// To make it easier to advance efficienty in single-sourced branches of tries, we extract the current smallest
/// cursor (the head) separately, and start any advance with comparing that to the heap's first. When the smallest
/// cursor remains the same (e.g. in branches coming from a single source) this makes it possible to advance with
/// just one comparison instead of two at the expense of increasing the number by one in the general case.
///

/// section and equalParent flag since comparisons of cursor positions are cheap.
