/// Cursor interface for deletion-aware tries that provides access to both live data and deletion branches.
///
/// This cursor extends the basic [Cursor] interface to support the dual nature of deletion-aware tries,
/// where live data and deletion information coexist in a unified structure. The cursor walks the live
/// data portion of the trie while providing access to deletion branches through the
/// [#deletionBranchCursor] method.
///
/// The cursor behaves like a standard trie cursor for live data, supporting all standard navigation and
/// content access operations inherited from [Cursor]. It can also be used as a plain trie cursor for
/// processing or iteration methods and classes, in which case only live data will be presented.
///
/// At any position, this cursor can provide access to deletion branches through [#deletionBranchCursor],
/// which returns a [RangeCursor] covering deletion ranges rooted at the current position. The deletion
/// information is only reachable after taking and following deletion branches. When a consumer is interested
/// in the deletion information, it can be merged into the main tree using [LiveAndDeletionsMergeCursor] or
/// presented as the full range trie via [DeletionsTrieCursor].
///
/// Deletion-aware cursors must maintain strict structural invariants to ensure correctness and efficiency:
///
/// **Non-Overlapping Deletion Branches**: No deletion branch can be covered by another deletion branch.
/// When a deletion branch exists at a given node, all descendants of that node must have null deletion
/// branches. This prevents nested deletion scopes and simplifies merge algorithms.
///
/// **Well-Formed Deletion Branches**: Each deletion branch must be a properly constructed range trie:
/// - It cannot start or end with an active deletion (no open-ended ranges at boundaries).
/// - Every deletion opened by an entry must be closed by the next entry.
/// - Preceding state must be correctly reported for all positions.
///
/// **Deletion Consistency**: There cannot be live entries in the trie that are deleted by deletion
/// branches in the same trie. This ensures that the trie represents a consistent view where deletions
/// have been properly applied.
///
/// @param <T> The content type for live data in the trie
/// @param <D> The deletion marker type, must extend `RangeState`
public interface DeletionAwareCursor<T, D extends RangeState<D>> extends Cursor<T>

    /// trie and nodes below it. The deletion branch is represented as a [RangeCursor] that can cover
    /// ranges of keys with deletion markers. It is presented as a tail cursor for the current position,
    /// i.e. it starts with depth 0 and cannot extend beyond the current position.
    ///
    /// When this method returns a non-null deletion branch, the source cursor is not allowed to return another deletion
    /// branch in the covered branch. In other words, for any given path in the trie there must be at most one node
    /// where [#deletionBranchCursor] is non-null.
