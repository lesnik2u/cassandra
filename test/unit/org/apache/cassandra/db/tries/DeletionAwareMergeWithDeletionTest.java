/// [DeletionAwareTrie#mergeWithDeletion] merges a bare [RangeTrie] into a deletion-aware trie, hoisting the deletion
/// branch to the root if it is not there already. Nothing tested it, on either side.
///
/// It is how `TrieBackedRow` applies a row deletion, and the shape it produces -- a deletion branch rooted at the
/// root, with the trie's own deletions pulled up into it -- is the one that hid several of the reader defects this
/// branch has already fixed. It also carries a `TODO: Optimize/simplify`, so pinning what it does today is most of
/// the value of the class.
///
/// The oracle is [DeletionAwareMergeTest#mergeLists] at the [DataPoint] list level, which is independent of the trie
/// code. Deliberately *not* `mergeWith(deletionBranch(EMPTY, ...))`: that is the implementation, so it would assert
/// nothing.
///
/// `deletionsAtRoot` drives both the shape of the trie being merged into and the flag the method is given, because
/// the flag is a promise that no source has a deletion branch above or below another's. With it, the trie already
/// has a branch at the root and the two must merge rather than replace one another; without it, the trie's branches
/// sit below the root and hoisting has to pull them up past the level they were introduced at -- the case most
/// likely to be wrong.
