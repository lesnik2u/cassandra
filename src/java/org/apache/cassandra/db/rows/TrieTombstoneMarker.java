/// - boundary markers, which switch from one deletion time to a different one (either of which may be null).
///

/// same (often null), but there is a deletion time applicable to the exact point. These are used to mark deletions at
/// the lowest points of the represented data hierarchy where no further complexity can exist below the marked point
