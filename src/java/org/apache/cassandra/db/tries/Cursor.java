/// A trie cursor.
///
/// This is the internal representation of a trie, which enables efficient walks and basic operations (merge,
/// slice) on tries.
///
/// The cursor represents the state of a walk over the nodes of trie. It provides three main features:
///   - the current [#depth] or descend-depth in the trie;
///   - the [#incomingTransition], i.e. the byte that was used to reach the current point;
///   - the [#content] associated with the current node,
///
/// and provides methods for advancing to the next position.  This is enough information to extract all paths, and
/// also to easily compare cursors over different tries that are advanced together. Advancing is always done in
/// order; if one imagines the set of nodes in the trie with their associated paths, a cursor may only advance from a
/// node with a lexicographically smaller path to one with bigger. The [#advance] operation moves to the immediate
/// next, it is also possible to skip over some items to a specific position ahead ([#skipTo]).
///
/// Moving to the immediate next position in the lexicographic order is accomplished by:
///   - if the current node has children, moving to its first child;
///   - otherwise, ascend the parent chain and return the next child of the closest parent that still has any.
///
/// As long as the trie is not exhausted, advancing always takes one step down, from the current node, or from a node
/// on the parent chain. By comparing the new depth with the one before the advance, one can tell if the former was
/// the case (if `newDepth == oldDepth + 1`) and how many steps up we had to take (`oldDepth + 1 - newDepth`) if it
/// wasn't. When following a path down, the cursor will stop on all prefixes.
///
/// When it is created the cursor is placed on the root node with `depth = 0`, `incomingTransition = 0`.
/// Since tries can have mappings for empty, `content()` can possibly be non-null. The cursor is exhausted when it
/// returns a depth of -1 (the operations that advance a cursor return the depth, and `depth()` will also
/// return -1 if queried afterwards). It is not allowed for a cursor to start in exhausted state; once a cursor is
/// exhausted, calling any of the advance methods or `tailTrie` is an error.
///
/// For example, the following trie:
/// <pre>
///  t
///   r
///    e
///     e *
///    i
///     e *
///     p *
///  w
///   i
///    n  *
/// </pre>
/// has nodes reachable with the paths
/// `"", t, tr, tre, tree*, tri, trie*, trip*, w, wi, win*`
/// and the cursor will list them with the following `(depth, incomingTransition)` pairs:
/// `(0, -1), (1, t), (2, r), (3, e), (4, e)*, (3, i), (4, e)*, (4, p)*, (1, w), (2, i), (3, n)*`
///
/// Because we exhaust transitions on bigger depths before we go the next transition on the smaller ones, when
/// cursors are advanced together, i.e. when we walk the combination of two or more cursors in order, where we would
/// want to advance the one that is earlier in the comparison order until it catches up, their positions can be easily
/// compared using only the `depth` and
/// `incomingTransition`:
///   - one that is higher in depth is before one that is lower;
///   - for equal depths, the one with smaller incomingTransition is first.
///
/// If we consider walking the trie above in parallel with this:
/// <pre>
///  t
///   r
///    i
///     c
///      k *
///  u
///   p *
/// </pre>
/// the combined iteration will proceed as follows:<pre>
///  (0, -1)+  (0, -1)+          cursors equal, advance both
///  (1, t)+   (1, t)+   t       cursors equal, advance both
///  (2, r)+   (2, r)+   tr      cursors equal, advance both
///  (3, e)+ < (3, i)    tre     cursors not equal, advance smaller (3 = 3, e < i)
///  (4, e)+ < (3, i)    tree*   cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 > 3)
///  (3, i)+   (3, i)+   tri     cursors equal, advance both
///  (4, e)  > (4, c)+   tric    cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 = 4, e > c)
///  (4, e)  > (5, k)+   trick*  cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 < 5)
///  (4, e)+ < (1, u)    trie*   cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 > 1)
///  (4, p)+ < (1, u)    trip*   cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 > 1)
///  (1, w)  > (1, u)+   u       cursors not equal, advance smaller (1 = 1, w > u)
///  (1, w)  > (2, p)+   up*     cursors not equal, advance smaller (1 < 2)
///  (1, w)+ < (-1, -1)  w       cursors not equal, advance smaller (1 > -1)
///  (2, i)+ < (-1, -1)  wi      cursors not equal, advance smaller (2 > -1)
///  (3, n)+ < (-1, -1)  win*    cursors not equal, advance smaller (3 > -1)
///  (-1, -1)  (-1, -1)          both exhasted
///  </pre>
///
/// To improve performance, `depth` and `incomingTransition` are encoded together in a single long that is set up in
/// a way that lets us compare positions (in the sense of the demonstration above) by comparing the encoded position
/// as an integer.
///

/// a cursor for a trie containing "ab", "abc" and "cba", will visit the nodes in order "cba", "ab", "abc", i.e.
/// prefixes will still be reported before their descendants.
